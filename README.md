# Project-HooBake-All-Documentation

This repository serves as a comprehensive documentation and resource hub for the **HooBake** project. Initially, manual testing was performed to validate core functionalities and user flows. Following this, automation testing was conducted using **Playwright**, covering both **positive and negative end-to-end scenarios** along with **integration testing**. Detailed automation test reports were generated to ensure system reliability, stability, and overall quality.
